      We welcome applicants interested in computer vision and deep learning to apply for our Master’s,
      Ph.D., and postdoctoral positions. We also invite motivated undergraduate students to join the lab
      as interns and participate in research projects and paper writing. Our lab has long been dedicated
      to research in image and intelligent information processing, with main topics including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Low-level image enhancement (e.g., low-light enhancement, glare removal, etc.)</li>
      <li>Infrared small target detection and tracking</li>
      <li>Medical image segmentation and intelligent diagnosis</li>
      <li>Recommender systems and user profiling</li>
      <li>Time-series analysis and spatiotemporal data mining</li>
